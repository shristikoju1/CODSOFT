                <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                <p>Ruit's journey into medicine was deeply influenced by a tragic event â€“ the death of his younger sister, Yangla, at the age of 15, due to tuberculosis. Yangla, his childhood companion, succumbed to the illness as the family couldn't afford the necessary treatment. This heartbreaking loss left an indelible mark on Ruit, inspiring him to become a doctor and dedicate his efforts to serving the less privileged in need of healthcare. <br><br>

                    Sent to St Robert's School in Darjeeling at the age of seven, with financial support from his father, Ruit faced challenges living away from his parents for four to five years. Despite the hardships, he persevered and returned to Nepal, graduating from Siddhartha Vanasthali School in Kathmandu in 1969. His educational journey continued in India, where he pursued a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at King George's Medical College, Lucknow, from 1972 to 1976, supported by a scholarship. <br><br>
                    
                    After working as a General Physician at Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, for three years, Ruit decided to specialize in ophthalmology. Further studies at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, led to the attainment of his Master's Degree by 1984. Returning to Nepal in the same year, he dedicated eight years to working in an eye hospital in Tripureshwor. <br><br>
                    
                    In 1986, Australian ophthalmologist Fred Hollows recognized Ruit's dedication and offered him an opportunity for further study in cataract surgery in Australia. There, Ruit and Hollows collaborated to develop Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) using intraocular lenses, a groundbreaking advancement in eye surgery. Ruit, becoming the first Nepali doctor to use intraocular lenses, then established the Nepal Eye Program Australia (later The Fred Hollows Foundation) to make eye surgeries more affordable and accessible in Nepal. Despite an offer to stay and work in Australia, Ruit chose to return to Nepal, resuming his work at the Tripureshwor eye hospital, showcasing his unwavering commitment to his home country and the improvement of eye care accessibility for its people.</p>
